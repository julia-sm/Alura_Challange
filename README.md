# Alura_Challange
A front-end project developed using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascrip where it was proposed to build a code editor similar to https://carbon.now.sh/ where you can edit your code and save it as a project

It was done all the HTML structure of both pages and the styles with the CSS.

Check out the design on figma: https://www.figma.com/file/Ve4hpTfmMa7yAFneoGtGKD/Alura-Challenge---Edi%C3%A7%C3%A3o-Front-end?node-id=207%3A729

I recomend opening the project using the Live Server extention on the visual studio code.
